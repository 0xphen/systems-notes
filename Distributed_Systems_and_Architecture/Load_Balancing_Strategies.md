# ⚖️ Understanding Load Balancing Strategies in Distributed Systems

---

## 📘 Question

**Today’s question:**

As a software engineer working on a high-traffic web application, Alex needs to implement a load-balancing strategy to distribute incoming HTTP requests evenly across multiple servers. **Which architectural approach should Alex consider?**

**Possible options:**

1. Using a **Round Robin** algorithm to route requests sequentially to each server.
2. Implementing a **Weighted Round Robin** algorithm to assign a higher weight to more powerful servers.
3. Utilizing a **Least Connections** algorithm to direct traffic to the server with the fewest active connections.
4. Deploying a **Random** algorithm to randomly select a server for each request.

---

## 🧩 1) What the Problem Means

Alex needs to keep the application responsive and reliable while traffic varies over time. The load balancer sits in front of many backend servers and decides **which server handles each request/connection**. The goal is to avoid **hot spots** (some servers overloaded while others are idle) and to keep **latency low** and **throughput high**.

Key challenge: choose a policy that balances **fairness** (even work distribution) with **simplicity** and **awareness of real workload** (e.g., long-lived connections, slow endpoints).

---

## ⚙️ 2) Key Concepts and Definitions

### 🚪 Load Balancer

A reverse proxy that accepts client requests and **dispatches** them to backend servers according to a policy. Can be L4 (connection-level) or L7 (application/HTTP-aware).

### 🌐 HTTP Requests vs Connections

* **Request-based**: each HTTP request can be sent to a server independently (common with HTTP/1.1 keep-alive or HTTP/2 multiplexing via L7 balancers).
* **Connection-based**: long-lived connections (e.g., WebSockets, gRPC streams) represent **sustained load** on a server; balancing should account for this ongoing work.

### 🧮 Homogeneous vs Heterogeneous Pools

* **Homogeneous**: all servers have similar CPU/RAM.
* **Heterogeneous**: some servers are stronger; algorithms may need **weights**.

### 🔒 Session Affinity (Stickiness)

Pinning a user/session to the same server for stateful apps. Helps with state but constrains perfect balancing.

### 🩺 Health Checks & Outlier Detection

Balancers must periodically check if servers are healthy and temporarily **eject** or **deprioritize** bad ones to prevent cascading failures.

---

## 🔁 3) Load-Balancing Algorithms—Concepts

### Round Robin (RR)

Cycles through servers **1 → 2 → 3 → … → 1**.

* **Model**: equal chance per *request*.
* **Assumption**: requests are short and similar.

### Weighted Round Robin (WRR)

Like RR, but servers get **weights** (e.g., a bigger box receives ~2× traffic).

* **Model**: proportional share by **capacity**.

### Least Connections (LC) / Weighted Least Connections (WLC)

Sends the next request/connection to the server with the **fewest active connections** (optionally factoring weights).

* **Model**: reacts to **current load** and **connection duration**.

### Random

Chooses a backend **uniformly at random** per request/connection.

* **Model**: statistical spread with higher variance than RR.

---

## 🌍 4) Distributed System Realities

* **Uneven request cost**: Some endpoints are heavy (file export), others light (health checks).
* **Long-lived work**: WebSockets/gRPC streams hold server resources for minutes/hours.
* **Burstiness**: Traffic arrives in spikes; good policies smooth pressure.
* **Observability**: Algorithms that reflect **live server state** (e.g., connection count) adapt better.

## 🔬 5) Comparing the Options

| Policy                     | Fairness Under Variable Durations | Handles Heterogeneous Capacity | Implementation Complexity | Typical Use Case                                |
| -------------------------- | --------------------------------- | ------------------------------ | ------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------- |
| **Round Robin (RR)**       | ❌ (blind to long requests)        | ➖ (no weights)                 | ✅ Simple                  | Short, uniform requests; identical servers      |
| **Weighted RR (WRR)**      | ❌ (still blind to durations)      | ✅ (weights)                    | ✅ Simple                  | Different-sized servers, still uniform traffic  |
| **Least Connections (LC)** | ✅ (reacts to live load)           | ✅ (weighted variant)           | ➖ Needs tracking          | High-traffic, mixed durations, long-lived conns |
| **Random**                 | ➖ (OK in small scale)             | ➖ (no weights)                 | ✅ Trivial                 | Baseline/testing; rarely best at scale          |

## 🧩 6) Explanation of Each Option

### Option 1: **Round Robin**

**Pros**

* Extremely simple and fast.
* Even *request counts* in homogeneous clusters.

**Cons**

* Ignores **request duration** and **connection length** → some servers end up with more *work* despite equal request counts.
* Not ideal for high traffic with mixed workloads.

**Best for**: small clusters; very uniform, short requests.

---

### Option 2: **Weighted Round Robin**

**Pros**

* Easy way to account for stronger/weaker servers.
* Maintains simplicity of RR with better proportionality.

**Cons**

* Still **blind to real-time load**; a weighted heavy server can be overloaded by a streak of long requests.

**Best for**: heterogeneous servers with still relatively uniform request cost.

---

### Option 3: **Least Connections (Recommended)**

**Pros**

* **Adaptive**: naturally directs new work to servers that are the least busy *right now*.
* Works well with **keep-alive, HTTP/2, WebSockets, gRPC**, and mixed endpoints.
* Weighted variant (**WLC**) handles heterogeneous capacity.

**Cons**

* Requires the balancer to **track active connections** (slightly more state/overhead).
* Connection count is a proxy for load (CPU/mem-aware load metrics can further improve).

**Best for**: **high-traffic** systems with variable request durations and long-lived connections.

---

### Option 4: **Random**

**Pros**

* Zero bookkeeping; very easy to implement.
* Surprisingly okay at small scale.

**Cons**

* Higher variance; may create **hot spots** compared to RR/LC.
* No concept of server capacity or live load.

**Best for**: tiny services, quick experiments, or as a baseline.

## 🧠 7) The “Right” Architectural Decision

For Alex’s **high-traffic web application**, traffic characteristics are unlikely to be uniform. Some requests will be heavier or longer-lived. The approach that **actively balances live work**—and therefore reduces tail latency and hot spots—is:

> **Use the Least Connections algorithm (preferably Weighted Least Connections if servers differ in capacity).**

This algorithm adapts to connection length and variable workloads better than RR/WRR/Random.

| Simplicity over quality | Random (generally not preferred in production)                                                  |
| Production hygiene      | Pair with **health checks**, **outlier detection**, and **optional session affinity** as needed |

## 📌 9) Core Principle to Remember

> **Balance *work*, not just request counts.** In high-traffic, mixed-duration environments, **Least Connections** best approximates fair, live load distribution.
